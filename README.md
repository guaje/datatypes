# Brainlife Datatypes

Brainlife apps exchanges input/output data through Brainlife datatypes defined by app developers. Brainlife datatype specifies a set of directories and files that an app can output as an ontput dataset and read by another app as an input dataset.

This repository provides a public forum (through Github Issues) to discuss and define new Brainlife datatypes. Once registered, datatype should remain static to preserve backward compatibility between the apps that use it and the datasets generated previously for the datatype.
