# Brainlife Datatypes

Brainlife apps exchanges input/output data through common datatypes defined by app developers. Datatypes defines a set of directories and files that one app can output as an ontput dataset and read by other app as an input dataset.

This repository provides a public forum (through Github Issues) to discuss and define new datatypes. Once registered, datatype should remain static to preserve backward compatibility between the apps and datasets generated previously.
